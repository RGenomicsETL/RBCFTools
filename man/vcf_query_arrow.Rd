\dontrun{
# Count variants per chromosome
vcf_query_arrow(
  "variants.vcf.gz",
  "SELECT CHROM, COUNT(*) as n FROM vcf GROUP BY CHROM"
)

# Filter high-quality variants
vcf_query_arrow(
  "variants.vcf.gz",
  "SELECT * FROM vcf WHERE QUAL > 30"
)

# Join multiple VCF files
vcf_query_arrow(
  c("sample1.vcf.gz", "sample2.vcf.gz"),
  "SELECT * FROM vcf WHERE POS BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000"
