\title{Query VCF/BCF with DuckDB via Arrow}
\usage{
vcf_query(vcf_files, query, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_files}{Character vector of VCF file paths}

\item{query}{SQL query string. Use "vcf" as the table name.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to vcf_open_arrow}

Query result as a data frame

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Count variants per chromosome
vcf_query(
    "variants.vcf.gz",
    "SELECT CHROM, COUNT(*) as n FROM vcf GROUP BY CHROM"
)

# Filter high-quality variants
vcf_query(
    "variants.vcf.gz",
    "SELECT * FROM vcf WHERE QUAL > 30"
)

# Join multiple VCF files
vcf_query(
    c("sample1.vcf.gz", "sample2.vcf.gz"),
    "SELECT * FROM vcf WHERE POS BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000"
)
}
